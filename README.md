Project Title: Uni Paradiso

1. Problem description
The modern gaming landscape is increasingly dominated by ‘Triple-A’ titles characterized by corporate bloat, formulaic storytelling, and predatory monetization. Instead of offering an artistic escape, many games utilize ‘dark patterns’- psychological loops designed to encourage gambling and excessive spending/ Furthermore, digital items in these ecosystems are ‘dead-end-assets’, which means players spend money or time acquiring items that hold no value once the player moves on. This stagnation has created a barrier for players seeking genuine creativity, social connection, and a sense of ownership over their digital experience.
	
2. Target users
	Nostalgia 
People who have played games for a while would love the 8bit design of the game. The game itself would take them back and they would take comfort in the familiarity of it.  
Indie
Indie games are a very popular category. Some people play games for the sake of it being an indie game, this would be able to reach them.  
Genre
Some people enjoy playing older games in general. Although this game is very recent, people would appreciate the old-like graphics for the game. Games like Stardew valley(10M+ sold), Undertale(10M+ sold) and Shovel Knight(10M+ sold) are all pixel games that have gained popularity and a strong consumer base. 
Space conserve 
Nowadays games take up a lot of storage, this makes the user upset and discouraged. Most users do not want a single game to take up their entire storage. Since our game will have low graphics,it will take up less storage. 
Youth 
The graphics and color style will be appealing to the younger audience. Kids often find the pixels to be visually appealing.
